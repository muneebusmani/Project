Introduction : –

Today everyone need legal services for some or the other reason. It is very difficult to find lawyers with respective specialization. Getting appointment is also very difficult. There is a need to have a website for doing all this.

We need to design and develop a website for lawyers and their service. Customers can register and search for lawyers basing their requirement. Info related to lawyers will be there in website which customers can browse through and view their profile before contacting them.

Customers can book a schedule for meeting with lawyer. We also had a discussion in regard to few clarifications and inputs specifically to understand the project flow.

    • Registration for customer as well as Lawyers.
    • Panel for Lawyers showcasing their details
    • Search by lawyer location, lawyer services like criminal, divorce, affidavit, civil, and then schedule a meeting with the same.
    • A customer search will show minimal info of a lawyer related to the service which customer searches, a click on lawyer profile should go to lawyer profile, where in customer can schedule a meeting and book a slot.
    • Login through normal registration form for customer is mandatory and for a lawyer registration form is required. Basically user/password required.
    • Showcase of the lawyer when they search one by one.
